            <h2>Dirk Kuyt</h2><br>
            <h4 style=" padding-left:10px;">Dutch Footballer Who played For Liverpool As A Winger as 3webet Official
              Brand Ambassador Year 2020-2021</h4>
            <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:10px;"> Dirk Kuyt is one of the hardest
              workers Anfield has ever seen - and his
              time at the club was punctuated by never-to-be-forgotten goals.
              In six years at Liverpool the Dutchman scored in Champions League and League Cup finals, hit hat-tricks
              and braces against our biggest
              rivals, and smashed home numerous crucial penalties.
              Originally signed by Rafael Benitez in 2006 as a striker,
              he proved himself to be selfless and versatile by operating just as often on the right wing.
              Kuyt arrived in England boasting a prolific goalscoring record in Dutch football, latterly with
              Feyenoord, and he instantly found favour on the Kop with an all-action debut as a substitute at home to
              West Ham United.
              The Netherlands international notched his first Liverpool goal against Newcastle United in September
              2006,
              and he'd net a further 13 in his debut season.
              At the end of that campaign, Liverpool reached a second Champions League final in three years, with Kuyt
              netting
              the winning penalty in the semi-final shootout triumph over Chelsea.
              He was rewarded with a starting place in the final against AC Milan and it was he who scored the Reds'
              late consolation in Athens on an otherwise disappointing night.
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:10px;"> One of the No.18's finest moments
              for the Reds came in October 2007
              with a penalty brace at Goodison Park as Liverpool clinched a dramatic last-minute win over their bitter
              rivals.
              This came just months after the death of his father, a personal tragedy which, by his own admission,
              impacted upon his game.
              However, at the end of 2007-08 Kuyt had returned to top form, with priceless goals against Marseille,
              Inter Milan and Arsenal
              helping the Reds reach another Champions League semi-final. Defeat by Chelsea followed, despite another
              goal in the Anfield leg
              to take his tally for the season to 11.
              By the start of 2008-09, Benitez had moulded the six-footer into an indispensable right winger, from
              where he scored 15 times
              to help Liverpool take champions Manchester United right to the wire.
              Kuyt continued his knack of breaking Everton hearts with goals in both 2009-10 derbies en route to a
              final haul of 11.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sadly, it proved to be a poor season for the club as a whole, with failure to qualify for the Champions
              League
              resulting in Benitez
              parting company with the Reds.
              The weeks that followed would go some way to easing Kuyt's disappointment, however, as the Netherlands
              reached their first World
              Cup final in 32 years.
              He started every game in the South Africa tournament, where his performances earned universal acclaim.
              Dutch icon Johan Cruyff
              was among those to laud the forward, claiming he was 'worth his weight in gold'.
              Despite Kuyt's best efforts, though, it was clubmates Fernando Torres and Pepe Reina who returned to
              Melwood with World Cup
              medals following Spain's extra-time victory.
              He found some consolation in top scoring for the Reds in 2010-11, with his tally of 15 including an
              unforgettable hat-trick
              against United at Anfield.
              The following season saw Kuyt finally collect a first medal with Liverpool. He scored a goal in
              extra-time and then converted
              a spot-kick in the Carling Cup shootout win over Cardiff City.
              It would prove to be one of his final acts in a Liverpool shirt. Kuyt left for a new challenge at
              Turkish side Fenerbahce
              in the summer of 2012 with his place as an Anfield great secure.
